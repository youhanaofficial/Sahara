# Sahara 🌍
_A learning-focused food surplus connectivity platform_

Sahara is a web-based project built to explore how technology can reduce food waste by connecting verified restaurants and charities through a simple, admin-moderated system. The platform focuses on fundamentals like role-based access, authentication, and real-world product constraints — without handling logistics or payments.

---

## Why Sahara?
- 🌾 Addresses food wastage through visibility, not logistics
- 🔐 Admin-approved users to maintain trust
- ⚙️ Built without APIs to understand core web fundamentals
- 🧠 Designed as a learning-first system, not over-engineered

---

## How It Works
1. Restaurants and charities register on the platform
2. Admin manually approves each account
3. Restaurants mark surplus food availability
4. Charities indicate urgency or raise foodraisers
5. Parties connect independently outside the platform

> Sahara acts only as a digital facilitator — it does not handle delivery, storage, or payments.
